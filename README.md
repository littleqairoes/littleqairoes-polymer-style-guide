# Little Qairoes Polymer Style Guide

_Still under construction_


## Purpose

_Opinionated Polymer style guide for teams by @tjmonsi, heavily inspired by [John Papa's Angular Style Guide](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/blob/master/a1/README.md)_

The purpose of this style guide is to provide guidance in building easy to understand and maintainable Polymer web app projects. These conventions are based on my development experience on Polymer and [Polymer patterns](https://github.com/PolymerLabs/polymer-patterns). You can take it as it is or modify it. If you have suggestions that would make this better, please feel free to make an issue above.

Many of my styles are influenced by patterns from Angular (from [John Papa's Angular Style Guide](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/blob/master/a1/README.md)) and React (from [Arunoda's Mantra Framework](https://github.com/kadirahq/mantra)). It is also heavily influenced by [Brad Frost's Atomic design](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/table-of-contents/)
